import (
    "bytes"
    "encoding/csv"

    "github.com/samber/ro"
    rocsv "github.com/samber/ro/plugins/encoding/csv"
)

var buf bytes.Buffer
writer := csv.NewWriter(&buf)

obs := ro.Pipe(
    ro.Just(
        []string{"name", "age", "city"},
        []string{"Alice", "30", "New York"},
        []string{"Bob", "25", "Los Angeles"},
        []string{"Charlie", "35", "Chicago"},
    ),
    rocsv.NewCSVWriter(writer),
)

sub := obs.Subscribe(ro.PrintObserver[int]())
