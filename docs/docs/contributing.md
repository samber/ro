# ü§ù Contributing

Hey! We are happy to have you as a new contributor. ‚úåÔ∏è

## Operator naming

Operators must be self-explanatory and respect standards (other languages, libraries...). Feel free to suggest many names in your contributions or the related issue.

`samber/ro` has been inspired by `ReactiveX` and `RxJS`. Find some inspiration in existing libraries:
- https://reactivex.io/documentation/operators.html
- https://reactivex.io/documentation/operators/buffer.html
- https://rxjs.dev/api

Many operators have variants. Please follow the same convention. Examples:

Map:
- Map: base operator
- MapI: the transformer function receives a forever increasing index
- MapWithContext: the transformer function receives a `context.Context`
- MapIWithContext: the transformer function receives a `context.Context` and a forever increasing index
- MapErr: the transformer function returns an error

Buffer:
- BufferWhen: the buffer is emitted on Observable notification
- BufferWithTime: the buffer is emitted when a timeout reached
- BufferWithCount: the buffer is emitted when size is reached
- BufferWithTimeOrCount: the buffer is emitted when a timeout or size is reached

Take:
- Take: emits N first items
- TakeWhile: emits items while a condition is met
- TakeUntil: emits items until a signal is sent over an Observable

Zip:
- Zip/ZipX/ZipAll/ZipWith/ZipWithX
- CombineLatest/CombineLatestX/CombineLatestAny/CombineLatestWith/CombineLatestWithX
- Merge/MergeAll/MergeWith/MergeWithX

...

We hate breaking changes, so better think twice ;)

## Context propagation in operators

`samber/ro` has been built with strict context propagation. New operators must not break the chain (propagation on subscription, message passing and unsubscription).

Example:
```go
func MapIWithContext[T, R any](project func(ctx context.Context, item T, index int64) (context.Context, R)) func(Observable[T]) Observable[R] {
	return func(source Observable[T]) Observable[R] {
        // This context has been provided by the downstream subscriber
		return NewUnsafeObservableWithContext(func(subscriberCtx context.Context, destination Observer[R]) Teardown {
			i := int64(0)

			sub := source.SubscribeWithContext(
                // Subscribe to upstream with context received from downstream
				subscriberCtx,
				NewObserverWithContext(
					func(ctx context.Context, value T) {
                        // The callback receives a context and return a new one (the same ?).
						newCtx, result := project(ctx, value, i)
                        // Use .NextWithContext(...) instead of .Next(...)
						destination.NextWithContext(newCtx, result)

						i++
					},
					destination.ErrorWithContext,
					destination.CompleteWithContext,
				),
			)

			return sub.Unsubscribe
		})
	}
}
```

## Variadic operators

Many operators accept variadic parameters, providing flexibility while maintaining type safety:

Examples:
- `ro.Zip(...Observable[T])`
- `ro.ZipAll(...Observable[T])`
- `ro.Merge(...Observable[T])`
- `ro.MergeWith[T any](...Observable[T])`

## Type aliases on generics

Some operators use `~[]T` constraints to accept any slice type, including named slice types, not just `[]T`. This design choice makes the library more flexible in real-world usage.

Examples:
- `func Flatten[T any, Slice ~[]T]() func(Observable[Slice]) Observable[T]`

## Variants

When applicable, some operator might be declined in multiple ways. Update the documentation for each helper.

Examples:
- Map: base operator
- MapI: the transformer function receives a forever increasing index
- MapWithContext: the transformer function receives a `context.Context`
- MapIWithContext: the transformer function receives a `context.Context` and a forever increasing index
- MapErr: the transformer function returns an error
- MapErrI: the transformer function returns an error
- ...

## Testing

We try to maintain code coverage high.

Use the `ro.Collect(...)` for testing.

Example:
```go
values, err := Collect(
    Pipe1(
        Just([]int{1, 2, 3}, []int{4, 5, 6}),
        Flatten[int](),
    ),
)
is.Equal([]int{1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6}, values)
is.NoError(err)
```

Test edge cases with `ro.Empty[int]()` and `ro.Throw[[]int](assert.AnError)` as source.

Example:
```go
values, err := Collect(
    Pipe1(
        Empty[[]int](),
        Flatten[int](),
    ),
)
is.Equal([]int{}, values)
is.NoError(err)

values, err = Collect(
    Pipe1(
        Throw[[]int](assert.AnError),
        Flatten[int](),
    ),
)
is.Equal([]int{}, values)
is.EqualError(err, assert.AnError.Error())
```

Test more edge cases:
- early unsubscription
- context propagation
- context cancellation

## Benchmark and performance

Write performant operators and limit extra memory consumption. Build an helper for general purpose and don't optimize for a particular use-case.

Feel free to write benchmarks.

Sources can be unbounded and might run for a very long time. If you expect a big memory footprint, please warn developers in the operator comment.

## Documentation

Operators must be properly commented, with a Go Playground link and a markdown documentation in `docs/data/`. In markdown header, please link to similar helpers (and update other markdowns accordingly).

Operator variants can be grouped in a single markdown.

New plugins must have their own page in `docs/docs/plugins/`.

Add your plugin or operator to `docs/static/llms.txt`.

## Examples

Create a [Go Playground](https://go.dev/play/) demonstration for each operator, allowing developers to quickly experiment and understand behavior without setting up a local environment.

Please add an example of your operator in the file named `ro_example_test.go`. It will be visible in Godoc website: https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/samber/ro
