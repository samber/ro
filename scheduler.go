Go is a modern programming language and doesn't need a scheduler.
It has multithreading built-in, so you don't need to worry about it.

If you come from PHP, Python, Javascript... welcome in the future! ðŸŽ‰

However, if you really want to Schedule() something such as a conference,
a meetup, a business lunch or ...a date ðŸ˜˜, you can reach me here:

More seriously, if you're looking for building a highly-parallel, concurrent,
scalable and reliable stream processing app, use "samber/ro" package instead
of "samber/so".
