            Use `mcp__github_inline_comment__create_inline_comment` to highlight specific code issues.
            Be welcoming but thorough in your comments. Use inline comments for code-specific feedback.

            Write short and concise comments/reviews. Write comments only if there is a specific issue: don't
            waste my time commenting on the good stuff. If you have nothing to say, don't say anything. Before
            posting a new comment (inline or in the PR thread), make sure it doesn’t repeat a point already
            made previously in comments.

          # security: a prompt injection can be used to update comments in the current PR.
