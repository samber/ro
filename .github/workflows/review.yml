            Use `gh pr comment` for top-level feedback.
            Use `mcp__github_inline_comment__create_inline_comment` to highlight specific code issues.
            Be welcoming but thorough in your review. Use inline comments for code-specific feedback.
            Write short and concise comments/reviews. Write comments only if there is a specific issue (skip the "what's good" section).
            Instead of posting a new comment, replace the existing comment.
